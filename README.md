## 1. Setup instructions

This repository contains the starting code for a lab-based React assessment. 

[https://github.com/rbirney/react-exam](https://github.com/rbirney/react-exam)

You are required to take the following steps in preparation for this exam.

## Clone the react-exam repository

- Choose a folder where you want to save the repository and open a command prompt in this location

- Clone the `react-exam` repository using the following command:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/rbirney/react-exam.git
~~~

### Add .env file

- Open the cloned project in Visual Studio Code

- Create an .env file in the base folder. 

- Add your TMDB API key (the same as you used in the React labs)

~~~bash
REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY=YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE
FAST_REFRESH=false
~~~

### Create your own repository

Create a new public repository in your GitHub account called 'reactExam'.

Copy the URL of your new repository.

Open a new terminal in VS Code (in your react-exam folder) and type the following commands:

~~~bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin ...URL of your new repository...
git push origin main
~~~

Verify that your GitHub repository now contains the starter app.


### Start the app

In your VS Code terminal, run the following commands:

~~~bash
npm install
npm start
~~~

Now check that the Movie App runs correctly and is accessible from a browser on your machine.


### Update README.md

Add your name and student number to the README.md file, as shown below:

~~~markdown
# React In-class Exam, November 2024

Your Name, Student Number
...
~~~

Push your changes to GitHub:

~~~bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Readme updated"
git push origin main
~~~

**Please ensure you have completed these steps before the lab-based exam and that you can push changes to your remote repository on GitHub.**


## 2. Submit to Moodle
